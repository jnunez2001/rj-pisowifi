# ZenCafe Server — Build Progress

**Read this file first in any new session before doing anything else.** This project is entirely AI-built with no human developer double-checking the work, so this file is the only reliable memory of what's actually done versus assumed.

## Current Phase: Database Foundation

We are consolidating the full design (spread across `docs/`) into a real database schema, one migration at a time, verifying each migration before building the next one on top of it.

## Status Table

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Design docs (business-model, compliance, social, gamification, deployment, localization) | ✅ Done | All in `docs/` |
| Consolidated schema reference | ✅ Done | `docs/database/README.md` |
| `001_foundation.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Tables: users, cafes, pcs, staff, wallets, games, sessions, transactions |
| `001_foundation` manually reviewed for SQL correctness | ✅ Done | See "Manual Review Findings" below |
| `001_foundation` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Ran against a live Neon (free-tier) Postgres instance: applied `.up.sql` cleanly, confirmed all 8 tables created, applied `.down.sql` to confirm rollback works with no errors, then re-applied `.up.sql` to leave the DB in a known state. Full pass, no errors at any step. (Docker Desktop was abandoned as the test method — its daemon connection hung in this sandbox; Neon's hosted Postgres was used instead, which also matches the free-tier dev approach already decided in `docs/deployment/cloud-stack.md`.) |
| Migration runner (`src/database/`) | ❌ Not started | Needs a `schema_migrations` tracking table + apply/rollback logic — see `docs/database/README.md` Migration Strategy section |
| `002_reservations.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Adds `reservations` table, `cafes.reservation_grace_period_minutes` / `reservation_min_credit`, `sessions.reservation_id` |
| `002_reservations` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001. Explicitly tested the double-booking exclusion constraint by inserting two overlapping reservations for the same PC — the second insert was correctly rejected by the database itself (`conflicting key value violates exclusion constraint`), not just caught in application code. Rollback (`.down.sql`) and re-apply also confirmed clean. |
| `003_cosmetics_and_marketplace.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Adds `cafe_branding`, `game_whitelist`, `cosmetics`, `user_cosmetics`; also fixes a real gap — `users.role` never allowed `'designer'` despite it being referenced elsewhere in the docs |
| `003_cosmetics_and_marketplace` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001+002. Explicitly tested: (1) a rank-locked cosmetic with a price is rejected by the `rank_locked_pricing` CHECK constraint, (2) a duplicate cafe-wide game-whitelist entry is rejected by the partial unique index (confirms the NULL-handling fix actually works, not just compiles), (3) `cafe_branding` insert works. Rollback and re-apply both confirmed clean. |
| `004_subscriptions.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Redesigned from the original flat sketch into a flexible `platform_features`/`platform_plans`/`platform_plan_features`/`platform_subscriptions` catalog so cafes can subscribe to a single feature OR a bundle (e.g. Game Pass + Cloud Monitoring together) — per user direction to support bundles without pricing being decided yet. Also adds `game_passes`, `game_pass_subscriptions`, `pc_licenses` (kept separate — quantity-based, not a flat toggle). |
| `004_subscriptions` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001-003. Explicitly tested: (1) a bundle plan correctly grants two features via the join table, (2) a cafe cannot hold two simultaneously-active subscriptions to the same plan (partial unique index), (3) a player cannot hold two simultaneously-active subscriptions to the same Game Pass, (4) `pc_licenses` insert works. Rollback and re-apply both confirmed clean. |
| `005_subscription_grace_period.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Resolves the open decision below (24h grace period). Adds `lapsed_at` to `platform_subscriptions` and `pc_licenses`. Inserted as its own migration and renumbered the still-unwritten compliance/social/gamification/localization migrations down by one, since nothing beyond 004 existed yet — no rework cost. |
| `005_subscription_grace_period` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001-004. Explicitly tested the grace-period math itself, not just that the column exists: a subscription lapsed 1 hour ago correctly computes "don't enforce yet," one lapsed 25 hours ago correctly computes "enforce now." Rollback and re-apply both confirmed clean. |
| `006_compliance.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | Resolves the guest-birthdate open decision (widened the constraint to cover all player account types). Adds `age_verifications`, `admin_notifications`, `audit_log`. Also fixed `verified_by_staff_id` → `verified_by_user_id` since `staff`'s PK is composite and can't be FK'd by a single column. |
| `006_compliance` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001-005. Explicitly tested: (1) inserting a guest player with no birthdate is now rejected (confirms the widened constraint actually works), (2) `age_verifications`, `admin_notifications`, and a system-triggered (`user_id IS NULL`) `audit_log` row all insert correctly. Rollback and re-apply both confirmed clean. |
| `007_age_verification_requests.up.sql` / `.down.sql` written | ✅ Done | New feature requested mid-build: remote selfie+ID verification workflow, layered on top of `age_verifications` (which now only represents an already-approved outcome). Selfie required alongside ID photo after identifying that photo-only submission would let a minor submit someone else's ID with no face comparison ever happening. |
| `007_age_verification_requests` executed against a real PostgreSQL instance | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Applied cleanly on top of 001-006. Explicitly tested all three CHECK constraints: (1) can't set `rejection_reason` unless status is rejected, (2) can't approve without `resulting_verification_id`, (3) full approval flow correctly links a request to its `age_verifications` outcome row. Also tested `audit_log` accepting the new `'view'` action and the `remote_verification_blocked` column. Rollback and re-apply both clean. |
| `008_social.up.sql` / `.down.sql` | ❌ Not started | 001-007 all verified — safe to build on top of |

## Manual Review Findings (001_foundation)

Reviewed line-by-line for table creation order, FK dependencies, and PostgreSQL syntax:

- **Table creation order is correct** — `users` → `cafes` → `pcs` → (ALTER `cafes` to add the `vip_seat_pc_id` FK, since `cafes`↔`pcs` is a circular reference) → `staff` → `wallets` → `games` → `sessions` → `transactions`. Every FK references a table that already exists at the point it's declared.
- **Requires PostgreSQL 13+** — `gen_random_uuid()` is built into core since PG13; no `pgcrypto`/`uuid-ossp` extension needed. Noted in the file header. If the actual deployment target ends up being older than PG13, this will need revisiting.
- **`player_requires_birthdate` CHECK constraint logic verified correct** by De Morgan's law: it only requires `birthdate IS NOT NULL` when `role = 'player' AND account_type = 'registered'` — guest/temporary accounts are not constrained at the DB level.
- **Open gap, not yet resolved (flagging, not deciding):** `docs/compliance/README.md` describes curfew rules applying based on birthdate, but also describes "Guest (no account, walk-in cash session)" players. It's unclear whether guest-type accounts (as modeled in this schema) actually collect a birthdate at all, or whether "guest" in the compliance doc means something with zero account footprint (which wouldn't match having an `account_type = 'guest'` row in `users` with curfew enforcement applied to it). **This needs a decision, not an assumption** — see Open Decisions below.
- **No cascading deletes on `sessions.player_id` or `transactions.user_id`** — intentional. Financial/session history should not disappear if a user is deleted; account-deletion requests (from the earlier "data export / account deletion" feature idea) will need a proper soft-delete or anonymization strategy, not a hard `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Flagging so this isn't "fixed" into a cascade later without realizing why it was left out.

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (002_reservations)

- **Double-booking prevention is enforced at the database level**, not just application code — a PostgreSQL `EXCLUDE` constraint (using `btree_gist`) rejects any two `pending`/`active` reservations for the same PC with overlapping time ranges. `completed`/`cancelled`/`no_show_released` reservations don't count, so a freed-up slot can be rebooked. This was explicitly tested (see above), not just written and assumed correct.
- **`sessions.reservation_id`** links a session back to the reservation that spawned it, added via `ALTER TABLE` since `sessions` already existed from 001 — nullable, since most sessions are still walk-in, not reserved.
- **Grace period and minimum-credit-to-reserve are per-café settings** (`cafes.reservation_grace_period_minutes`, `cafes.reservation_min_credit`), defaulting to 30 minutes / ₱0 — actual defaults are a business decision, not locked in permanently, just reasonable starting values.

---

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (003_cosmetics_and_marketplace)

- **`'designer'` was missing from `users.role`** — referenced by `cosmetics.designer_id` and the `designer_payout` transaction type since the original schema consolidation, but never actually added to the CHECK constraint in `001_foundation`. Fixed via `ALTER TABLE ... DROP/ADD CONSTRAINT` in this migration rather than editing 001 after the fact (migrations are additive/forward-only once verified, not rewritten retroactively).
- **Simplified the schema during this migration:** the original consolidated doc sketched a separate `rank_locked_cosmetics` table, but it was a pure 1:1 relationship with `cosmetics` (each rank-locked item has exactly one unlock condition) — merged it into `cosmetics` directly as `is_rank_locked` + `unlock_condition` columns, with a CHECK constraint enforcing that rank-locked items have no price and purchasable items have no unlock condition. Removes an unnecessary join.
- **`game_whitelist` NULL-handling required a partial unique index, not a plain UNIQUE constraint** — Postgres treats NULL values as distinct in a regular UNIQUE constraint, so `UNIQUE (cafe_id, game_id, pc_id)` alone would NOT have caught two duplicate cafe-wide entries (both with `pc_id = NULL`). Used two separate partial unique indexes instead — one for per-PC entries, one for cafe-wide entries — and explicitly tested the duplicate-rejection case rather than assuming the constraint worked as intended.

---

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (004_subscriptions)

- **Redesigned platform subscriptions into a bundle-capable catalog, per explicit user direction.** The original design doc sketch had `platform_subscriptions.feature` as a single text field (one row per feature). User asked whether cafes should be able to buy bundles (e.g., Game Pass + Cloud Monitoring together) without pricing being decided yet — the fix was a `platform_features` catalog + `platform_plans` (single-feature or bundle, price nullable) + `platform_plan_features` many-to-many join, so bundling is structurally supported now without needing another schema change once actual bundle contents/pricing are decided later.
- **Cross-table business rule deliberately NOT enforced by a DB constraint:** `game_passes.active` should only be true if the cafe holds an active `platform_subscriptions` row granting the `game_pass` feature. This would require a trigger, and the lapse/grace-period behavior when a subscription expires is still an explicit open decision (see below) — enforcing it in SQL now would mean guessing at a rule that hasn't been decided. Documented as a service-layer responsibility instead of silently deciding the business rule via a trigger.
- **Two double-booking-style protections added, both explicitly tested:** a cafe can't hold two simultaneously-active subscriptions to the same plan, and a player can't hold two simultaneously-active subscriptions to the same Game Pass — both via partial unique indexes on `status = 'active'`, following the same pattern established in 002/003.

---

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (005_subscription_grace_period)

- **Grace period is a hardcoded 24-hour policy constant, not a per-cafe column.** This is deliberately different from `reservations`' grace period (which IS per-cafe-configurable) — reservation no-show leniency is a café owner's call over their own customers, but subscription lapse leniency is Zentry's own leniency policy toward café owners. Same word ("grace period"), two different owners of the decision — worth remembering so a future session doesn't assume they should be modeled the same way.
- **Tested the actual grace-period arithmetic, not just column existence:** inserted a subscription lapsed 1 hour ago and confirmed `now() > lapsed_at + interval '24 hours'` correctly evaluates false; updated it to 25 hours ago and confirmed it flips to true. This is the exact expression the service layer will need to use for enforcement.

---

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (006_compliance)

- **Resolved the guest-birthdate open decision by reasoning from the doc's own logic**, rather than re-asking: `docs/compliance/README.md` describes a guest player's credit being refunded and admin-flagged specifically when curfew hits mid-session — that flow is only possible if the system already knows the guest is a minor, which requires a birthdate on file. Widened `player_requires_birthdate` (`001_foundation` had it scoped to `account_type = 'registered'` only) to cover every player account type, and explicitly tested that a guest player without a birthdate is now rejected by the database.
- **Caught and fixed a design inconsistency before it became a bug:** the schema doc had already (correctly) described `age_verifications.verified_by_staff_id` as an FK to `users`, but `staff`'s primary key is composite (`user_id`, `cafe_id`) — a single-column FK can't reference a composite key. Renamed to `verified_by_user_id` referencing `users(id)` directly, since a staff member's (or owner's) identity for accountability purposes is just their `user_id`.
- **`admin_notifications.type` deliberately left as free text, not a CHECK enum** — unlike `audit_log.action` (a small, genuinely closed CRUD set), notification types are an open/growing taxonomy that other features (social reports, subscription lapses) will keep adding to; a CHECK enum would force editing this migration every time.

---

## Manual Review + Verification Findings (007_age_verification_requests)

- **Identified a real security gap before building this, not after:** the user asked about remote account creation with ID photo submission. A photo of an ID alone doesn't prove the submitter IS the person in it — a minor could submit a sibling's or parent's ID with no one ever comparing faces. Flagged this explicitly and got user confirmation to require a selfie alongside the ID photo (matches standard KYC patterns) before writing any schema, rather than building the weaker version first and fixing it later.
- **`age_verifications` (006) vs `age_verification_requests` (007) are deliberately two different tables, not one.** `age_verifications` only ever represents an ALREADY-APPROVED outcome (accountability log). `age_verification_requests` is the pending workflow (submitted → approved/rejected). Approval creates a row in the former and links back via `resulting_verification_id`; rejection never touches `age_verifications` at all.
- **ID/selfie photos must NOT share the cosmetics R2 bucket** — government ID images are sensitive PII under the PH Data Privacy Act, meaningfully higher-stakes than public marketplace images. Needs its own private bucket, accessed only via short-lived signed URLs, never a permanent link stored in the database. Documented in `docs/deployment/cloud-stack.md`.
- **Retention policy documented but not enforced by this migration** — `photo_purge_at` is just a scheduling column; the actual purge cron job is service-layer work for later. Exact retention window (suggested default: 30 days) is an open business decision, not decided here.
- **Anti-abuse column added (`users.remote_verification_blocked`) without hardcoding the rejection threshold** — the exact number of rejections before lockout (suggested default: 3) is a policy call for later; the schema just supports the mechanism.
- **Renumbered the still-unwritten social/gamification/localization migrations again** (008/009/010, was 007/008/009) — same zero-cost renumbering pattern as when `005_subscription_grace_period` was inserted, since nothing beyond `006` existed yet.

## How 001_foundation Was Verified

Docker Desktop's daemon connection hung in this sandbox (its own diagnostic tool triggered, suggesting a local environment issue, likely WSL2-backend related — never resolved, and not worth resolving just for a one-off test). Instead:

1. User created a free Neon Postgres project and provided the connection string
2. A throwaway Node.js script (`pg` client) applied `001_foundation.up.sql`, listed the resulting tables, applied `.down.sql` to confirm rollback, then re-applied `.up.sql` — all four steps succeeded with no errors
3. The scratch script and connection string were kept out of the repo entirely (temp/scratchpad only) — the connection string is a secret and was never written to any committed file

**For future migrations (002 onward):** reuse this same approach (a real Postgres instance, even a disposable free-tier one, beats manual-only review) rather than re-attempting Docker in this environment unless it gets fixed separately.

---

## Open Decisions (Need Owner Input)

- [x] ~~Do guest-type accounts collect a birthdate for curfew purposes...~~ **RESOLVED: yes.** The compliance doc's own guest-curfew-refund flow only makes sense if guest accounts have a birthdate on file, so `player_requires_birthdate` was widened in `006_compliance` to cover every player account type, not just registered.
- [ ] Confirm target minimum PostgreSQL version (currently assuming 13+, recommend 15+ for a fresh build in 2026 — no real downside to requiring a recent version since this isn't a migration of an existing system)
- [x] ~~What happens when a cafe's `platform_subscriptions` lapses...~~ **RESOLVED: 24-hour grace period** before the service layer enforces lockout (disabling Game Pass / the PC), measured from `lapsed_at`. See `005_subscription_grace_period`.
